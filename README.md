# LWC-Prototyping-App

Used to create a prototype of product tiles that easily demonstrate how to work with base lightning web components and standard nested custom events. This prototype was built using [webcomponents.dev studio](https://studio.webcomponents.dev/view/ochBttz8SBHaRPb67hav) and uses JSON data to build the list of tiles.
